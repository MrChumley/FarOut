//	The Kessler Run -by MrChumley.  For Kerbal Space Program.
//	Requires Contract Configurator. Forum link http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604
// 	Adds a Contract to recover a prebuilt SSTO spaceplane from Asclepius.
//---2017---\\
//---These Contract Configurator configs by MrChumley are meant to be used with:---\\
//--- Asclepius (a Kopernicus planet) mod: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126515 ---\\
//--- The mod Contract Configurator http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604 by nightingale is required to use the configs.---\\
//--- Kopernicus and Module Manager are required for the planet mods: Asclepius, and Kronkus ---\\
