//---2017---\\
//---These Contract Configurator configs by MrChumley are meant to be used with:---\\
//--- Kronkus (a Kopernicus planet pack) http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132379 ---\\
//--- Asclepius (a Kopernicus planet) mod: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126515 ---\\

    description = Far Out scientists were so pleased with how this new "Huge Spaceplane on Kersex" contract was going that they had a bit of a logistical lapse in judgment.  They forgot the keys.  The eggheads upstairs say to control it from a forward facing docking port, and that the engines and most things on the plane should work with actiongroups, but they need someone to deliver the keys to unlock the doors of the gargantuan ship and fly it into orbit.  A pilot, and an engineer might come in handy, but are not required.  They don't care what you do with it afterwards, as long as you appear "busy with science stuff".  This is where you come in.
    synopsis = Rendezvous with the Eternia space-plane at Kersex base, then take off, and fly Eternia to orbit around Kersex.
    completedMessage = Wonderful job!  The Eternia space-plane has made it into orbit in one piece! May she serve you well in your travels.
